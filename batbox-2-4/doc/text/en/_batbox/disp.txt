BATBOX (/D)

        Outputs text.

SYNOPSIS

   BATBOX /d text

        Outputs text.

        - TEXT : text to output

NOTES

        The /D switch does not output a new line at the end of TEXT, thus, 
     the next output will be stuck to TEXT

        The TEXT must not contain specials chars (ie. borders), otherwise, 
     these characters will be replaced by symbols of pure US-ASCII like ``-'' 
     or ``+''. This limatation can be skirt by the following code :

   BatBox /d "text"&ECHO border
