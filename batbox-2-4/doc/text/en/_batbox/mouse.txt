BATBOX (/M)

        Gets a mouse input from the user.

SYNOPSIS

   BATBOX /m

        Wait until user clicks on the console and then output a string like 
     X:Y:TYPE. Thus, decoding the click result needs a FOR (see `../for') 
     loop.

        - X : Click's column (start at 0)

        - Y : Click's line (start Ã  0)

        - TYPE : The click type:

             - 1 : left click

             - 2 : right click

             - 3 : left double-click (returns first a left click)

             - 4 : right double-click (returns first a right click)

NOTES

        TYPE values are for BatBox (see `../batbox') since version 2.2. 
     Before, the returned TYPE is undefined because of bug.

        To ease use of switch /M you can use the following script :

   :: Mouse ptrX ptrY ptrType
   :: ptrX : pointer to X
   :: ptrY : pointer to Y
   :: ptrType : pointer to Type
   :Mouse_
   FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3 delims=:" %%A in ('BatBox /m') DO (
    SET %3=%%C
    SET %2=%%B
    SET %1=%%A
   )
   GOTO:EOF
