BATBOX (/A)

     Outputs the character associated with a code, for a charset. This charset 
     might be either a single-byte charset (like ASCII, ANSI) or any kind of 
     multi-byte charset (like UTF-8), provided that the size of a multibyte 
     characted will not exceed 4 byte length.

SYNOPSIS

         BATBOX /a code

        - CODE : Code of the character to output. If you use a multibyte 
          charset, (like UTF-8), you must specify all byte used to code the 
          character, in a reversed order. For example the character ``â–ˆ'' is 
          coded by 0XE2 0X96 0X88 in UTF-8, so that the CODE to be passed to 
          BatBox (-> ``../batbox'') should be 0X8898E2.

NOTES

     To get easely a table of characters and their associated codes, you can 
     use the following script.

         @ECHO OFF
         SET code=0
         :Boucle
         BATBOX /d "code %code% : " /a %code% /a 10 /a 13
         :: les caracteres ASCII 10 et 13 are used for new line
         SET /a code=%code%+1
         IF NOT %code%==256 GOTO :Boucle
         PAUSE
