{{SpriteBox command}}

	{Spritebox} is a command to be used with {batbox|BatBox}. Indeed, it generates {batbox|BatBox} command
	lines from text files containing an {ASCII-Art}.
	
{{Synopsis}}

${	SPRITEBOX [/O] [/E[:]encoding] file}

	Generates a {BatBox} command line.

	- {file} : the path of the file containing the {ASCII-Art} to be converted to a {batbox|BatBox} command-line.
	
	- {/E[:]encoding} : specifies the encoding of the file containing the {ASCII-Art}. {Encoding} can be one of
	the following values:
	
		-- {byte} : the encoding is byte based. Then {spritebox} processes the file like it was encoded in a single byte
		charset, regardless of which charset it is.
		
		-- {utf-8} : the encoding is {utf-8}. Then it writes compatible command lines for utf-8 characters.
	
	- {/O} : the background of the sprite will be opaque (ie. space will not be ignored).
	
	The command line is printed to {standard output} (by default the console, but it can be redirected)

{{Compatibility}}

	{SpriteBox} is compatible with any batbox version since {version 1.1}. It is easily portable to other
	operating systems.
