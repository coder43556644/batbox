{{BatBox (/o)}}

	Moves console's origin (ie. the point that {BatBox} considers as the point of coordiates {(0,0)}). This command
	affects later {goto|BatBox (/g)} behaviours.
	
{{Synopsis}}

${	BATBOX /o OffsetX OffsetY}

	Moves console's origin.
	
	- {OffsetX} : Column number of the new origin (starts at 0 (leftmost column)).
	
	- {OffsetY} : Line number of the new origin (starts at 0 (top)).
	
	Later commands {goto|BatBox(/g)} will behave like they moved the cursor to the point of coordinates
	{(X+OffsetX,Y+OffsetY)}
	
{{Compatibility}}

	This command is avaliable since version {2.3}.
