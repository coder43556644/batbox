{{BatBox (/a)}}

	Outputs the character associated with a code, for a charset. This charset might
	be either a single-byte charset (like {ASCII}, {ANSI}) or any kind of multi-byte
	charset (like {UTF-8}), provided that the size of a multibyte characted will not
	exceed 4 byte length.

{{Synopsis}}

${	BATBOX /a code}

	- {code} : Code of the character to output. If you use a multibyte charset, (like {UTF-8}),
	you must specify all byte used to code the character, in a reversed order. For example the character
	``â–ˆ'' is coded by {0xE2 0x96 0x88} in {UTF-8}, so that the {code} to be passed to {../batbox|BatBox}
	should be {0x8898E2}.
	
{{Notes}}

	To get easely a table of characters and their associated codes, you can
	use the following script.

${	@ECHO OFF
	SET code=0
	:Boucle
	BATBOX /d "code %code% : " /a %code% /a 10 /a 13
	:: les caracteres ASCII 10 et 13 are used for new line
	SET /a code=%code%+1
	IF NOT %code%==256 GOTO :Boucle
	PAUSE}
